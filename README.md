## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I improved my understanding of Tailwind CSS, particularly in responsive design. Here’s an example of responsive image handling using Tailwind:

```html
<img src="./assets/images/image-omelette.jpeg" alt="Omelette" class="h-[171px] w-full object-cover md:hidden">
```

This allows me to hide certain images on larger screens while showing different ones for better performance and layout.

### Continued development

I plan to continue improving my skills in responsive design and CSS utility frameworks like Tailwind. Future projects will involve more interactive elements and dynamic layouts.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This is the official documentation for Tailwind, and it helped me understand how to structure my layout and style efficiently.
